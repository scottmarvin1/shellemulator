# shellemulator
Linux style shell taking advantage of underlying system calls in the C programming language

getword.c and p2.c are the files written by me, getword.h, p2.h, and the makefile were provided by
the legend himself, my Professor John Carroll.

Should work on all linux distros as well as MacOS.
